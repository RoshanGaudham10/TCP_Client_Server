# TCP_Client_Server
This is a simple C program to implement TCP Client Server communication.
This server code can handle multiple clients at a time and can create folders for each client and save and manipulate its contents independently.
The client code given has a unique ID, which will be copied by the server socket to distinguish between multiple connected clients.
